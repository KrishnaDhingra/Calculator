## Calculator
Hello everyone,
I've tried to replicate the windows calculator using html, css and vanilla js.
There are 4 modes that are available in the Calculator. They are:
Standard Calculator
Temperature Converter
Currency Converter
Length Converter

To make the currency converter I've used a currency converter API (https://www.currencyconverterapi.com/).
